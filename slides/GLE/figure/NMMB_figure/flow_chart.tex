\caption{Flow Chart of Coarse Grained Modeling. Firstly, the dynamics of the reduced-dimension variables are extracted from a full-dimension system  by Mori-Zwangzig (MZ) formalism. The resulting severely low-dimensional model, referred to as the generalized Langevin equation (GLE), consists of a Markovian (conservative) term, a memory (fluctuation) term, and a noise (random) term, where fluctuation and random term are connected with celebrated fluctuation dissipation theorem. Mathematically exact as the MZ operator is, obtaining expression of conservative term and fluctation term are challenging, due to the limited knowledge of the MZ operators for extremely high dimensional and nonlinear system. Instead, attention grabbing driven learning algorithm amazingly achieved great success on inferring manybody formula of conservative term from data. The paper will focus on solving the state and time dependent problem (marked red in the figure) by data driven method.}
