\begin{frame}{Abstract}
In this paper, we develop a \textbf{novel local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods} for \textbf{fractional diffusion equations} with \textbf{non-smooth solutions}.  
We consider such problems, for which the solutions are not smooth at boundary, and therefore the traditional LDG methods with piecewise polynomial solutions suffer accuracy degeneracy.  The novel LDG methods utilize a solution information enriched basis, and simulate the problem on a paired special mesh, and \textbf{achieve optimal order of accuracy}. We analyze the $L^2$-stability and optimal error estimate in $L^2$-norm.  
Finally, numerical examples are presented for validating the theoretical conclusions.
